          <h3>Before Noxus</h3>
          <p>
            Noxus was first formed by mordakaiser, a dead warlord brought back
            by sorcerors. He created the immortal bastion, the capital of Noxus.
            Mordakaiser was then defeated by the surrounding tribes called the
            Noxei.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>Start of The Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            After they defeated Mordakaiser, they created the empire of Noxus as
            the Immortal bastion its center capital. After creating Noxus, the
            people expanded untill the other countries used powerful crystals
            that created the world. Because of this the world was destroying
            itself. So the Noxians retreated to the Immortal Bastion to get out
            of the path of destruction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>The Founding of Noxus</h3>
          <p>
            After the wielders of the crystals detroyed each other, they came
            out more united than ever as one unit. They continued theyre
            conquest and took over alot of land. It was easy untill they met
            damacia. Demacia was able to push back noxus almost to its capital
            after killing one of their major warlords, Sion, but he was able to
            slay the king of Damacia.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>Ionian Invasion</h3>
          <p>
            At the same time The emperor of Noxus was old and seeking eternal
            life, so he sent an invasion force to Ionia. Ionia was made of self
            governing tribes with almost no army. Therefore when Noxus invaded
            Ionia, in search of magical artifacts to prolong the emperor's life,
            Ionia stood no chance. Noxus was able to easily reach the holy place
            of Ionia and ship all its artifacts back to Noxus. Thats when Ionia
            started to rebel using its martial arts and dance forms and turning
            them into weapons. They were able to push back Noxus. Thats why
            Swain, a general in Noxus, was almost killed.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>The rebellion and the creation of the Trifarix</h3>
          <p>
            As he was about to die a crow came and told him of darkness in
            Noxus. He found out that the emperor of Noxus was being controlled
            by LeBlanc, who Swain thought was dead. So he returned to the
            capital and got the power of a demon. Using his political influence,
            he was able to get the support of many nobles, one being katarina's
            dad. With the support of the nobles, Swain was able to kill the
            emperor and take over Noxus. With control of Noxus, he created the
            Trifarix. A group of three poeple to rule different parts of noxus
            and keep eachother in check. The three poeple being Swain, Darius,
            and LeBlanc. Which sums up the hisotry of noxus to where you can
            understand what the trifarix is.
