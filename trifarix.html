        <h3>What is the trifarix</h3>
        <p class="text-content">
          The Trifarix is a group of 3 people who rune and govern different
          aspects of Noxus. These poeple are the grand general swain Swain,
          Darius the hand of Noxus, and the faceless. each leader rules with a
          principle, darius being the principle of Might, swain the principle of
          Vision, and the faceless the principle of Guile

        <h3>Swain</h3>
        <p class="text-content">
          Swain is the Noxian grand general. He is the main face of
          thegovernment but that does not mean he holds the most power. He was
          born into a patrician family, which is a family in roman times that
          held great power, they were the empire's military, religious, and
          political leaders. Most were wealthy land owners from old families but
          some were families recently appointed by the emperor. All to say that
          this is another reference to the Roman empire and how Noxus is
          influenced by it. Swain being in such a powerful family guaranteed
          privileged life. Swain reached his position in the army after he
          executed prominante members of a group he called the hidden cabal
          which his house had conspired into. He even had to execute his own
          parents because they were also inn the hidden cabal. Because of this
          he was granted a commision into the army. In one of his campaingns
          with his war band in Ionia, he set a trap for the Ionians, but they
          were over run and Swain was almost killed. As he lay on the verge of
          death, a raven approached to feed, and Swain felt an old, familiar
          darkness press upon him again. But he would not let it take him. He
          could not. Staring into the the bird’s eye, he saw reflections of the
          evil strangling the heart of Noxus. A black rose. The pale woman...
          and her puppet emperor. Swain realized that he had not defeated the
          hidden cabal, and they had betrayed him to what should have been his
          death, after seducing Darkwill, the man they failed to overthrow. So
          he swain went back to the heart of Noxus to find the power his parents
          were talking about. He found it and leanred to control it. He then
          plotted to overthrow the puppet emperor for many years. When he finaly
          revolted, he used the power of the demon he learned to control to kill
          DarkWill himself. He then set up the trifarix because he believes that
          one person cannot rule Noxus incase he becomes corrupted, controlled
          and so on. Thats why he made 3 people in charge to keep eachother in
          check.

        <h3>Darius</h3>
        <p class="text-content">
          r more numerous foe. He was rewarded with a senior command of his own,
          attracting many thousands of eager recruits from across the empire.
          Darius turned the majority away, accepting only the strongest, the
          most disciplined and iron-willed. Such was his fearsome notoriety,
          even in the lands beyond Noxus, that it was not uncommon for entire
          cities to surrender at the first sight of his banners. After a
          grinding victory against the cloud-fortresses of the Varju, a proud
          warrior people who had resisted decades of Noxian aggression, Darius
          was named the Hand of Noxus by Emperor Boram Darkwill himself. Those
          who knew Darius best knew he craved neither power nor adulation—he
          wished merely to see Noxus triumph over all—so Darkwill ordered him
          and his warhosts far north into the Freljord, to finally bring the
          barbarian tribes to heel. The campaign dragged on for years, ending in
          a bitter, icy stalemate. Darius narrowly survived assassination
          attempts, ambushes, and even capture by the vicious Winter’s Claw. He
          was growing weary of endless wars of attrition, and returned to Noxus
          to demand a reconsolidation of the military. He marched his veterans
          into the capital, only to find that the emperor was dead, killed in a
          coup led by Jericho Swain. The act had been supported by many allies,
          including Darius’s own brother, Draven. This was a difficult position.
          As Hand, many of the noble houses would expect Darius to avenge
          Darkwill, but he had known and greatly respected the disgraced general
          Swain, and had spoken against his discharge after the botched
          offensive in Ionia some years earlier. The oaths of the Hand were to
          Noxus, not any particular ruler, and Swain was a man who spoke
          honestly of his new vision for the empire. Darius realized this was a
          leader he was prepared to follow... but Swain had other ideas. With
          the establishment of the Trifarix, three individuals would rule Noxus
          together, each embodying one principle of strength: Vision, Might, and
          Guile. Darius gladly accepted his place on this council, and pledged
          to raise a new, elite force—the Trifarian Legion, the most loyal and
          prestigious warriors the empire could produce—and lead the armies of
          Noxus into a glorious new age of conquest.

        <h3>The Faceless</h3>
        <p class="text-content">
          Identity is officially a mystery. Rumored to puppeteer the dark
          underbelly and politics of Noxus. Unknown status to outsiders suits
          the Trifarix's and the Faceless' purposes: sowing fear, suspicion, and
          unease among the enemies of Noxus allows the Faceless to walk more
          freely among those who might have their guard up. Poeple have
          theorized that they are Leblanc, but a rioter has confirmed that it is
          not Leblanc.
