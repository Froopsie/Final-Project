          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Jeremy and I am a college student who made this Website
            as a project for my Web Design Course. I am just starting to learn
            about web development so do not expect this website to look super
            beautiful.

          <h3>Why did I decide to do this?</h3>
          <p>
            I decided to do my website on this topic because I wnated to learn
            more about the lore on league of legends. Noxus is one of my
            favorite factions and I wanted to understand who was incharge and
            what happened to make it that way.
          </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h3>Am I going to continue this page?</h3>
          <p>
            I do not plan to continue this website any further than I have. If I
            do continue this website I will update this part of the website.
            Thank you very much for visiting my website and I hope you learned
            as much about noxian lore as I have. See you around!
